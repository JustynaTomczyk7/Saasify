## General info

This is my first website that I created after learning HTML and CSS. The site was based on graphics downloaded from www.figma.com and my own modifications.

I decided on this project because it contains a lot of elements for styling, which was an ideal way to test the knowledge I gained in practice.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
